    How is it different from other similar projects? How is Cuckoo AI's
    decentralized model-serving different from io.net, Gensyn, nimble, Kuzco,
    Morpheus AI, etc?
  </summary>
  <p class="mt-2">
    Our decentralized marketplace seamlessly connects GPU miners with generative
    AI builders, enabling miners to serve AI models immediately. This approach
    optimizes GPU resource utilization, mitigates centralization risks, and
    delivers immediate value to AI consumers. Leveraging a decentralized
    network, we can reduce costs for generative AI builders by up to 60%.
