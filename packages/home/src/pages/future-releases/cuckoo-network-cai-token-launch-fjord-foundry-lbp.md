description: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems hold unprecedented potential to reshape industries, yet their development has been stifled by issues inherent to centralized frameworks. These range from significant privacy concerns to limitations in computational accuracy and a vulnerability to censorship.

**TLDR;**

- **Cuckoo Network Launch Event** via Fjord Foundry Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) on Arbitrum
- Starts August 27th at 2pm UTC / 10am EDT and lasts for 72 hours
- 50,000,000 CAI or 5% of total supply will be available to the public
- Fair and transparent token distribution with no minimums or lockups

**Cuckoo Network LBP Details** A liquidity bootstrapping pool (LBP) is a fair and transparent way to distribute tokens to the community. For the Cuckoo Network Launch Event, 50,000,000 CAI or 5% of total CAI supply will be paired with 50,000 USDC in a Balancer-style liquidity pool on Arbitrum.

At the start of the LBP, there will be an initial token weight ratio of 99% CAI: 1% USDC, making the cost to acquire CAI relatively high. However, CAI price will drop over the 72 hour period as the ratio auto-balances based on the pool's price decay curve.

Price declines can be reversed by buying pressure from LBP participants. The price decay mechanism allows users to express their cost preference of CAI allowing for a free-market approach to price discovery. However, the time constraint of 72 hours means users cannot wait too long or else miss the opportunity to participate in the LBP before CAI hits the open market.

Ultimately, the price curve from the LBP incentivizes a more equal distribution of CAI tokens given anyone can permissionlessly buy into or sell out of the LBP anytime without minimum purchasing requirements or lockups.

**Cuckoo Network** Decentralized AI model serving marketplace enabling GPU and CPU miners to share their resources with generative AI app builders for image generation and LLM inference on Cuckoo Chain. Key features include:

- Decentralized Inference with Coordinator Nodes and GPU Miner Nodes
- Cuckoo Chain: an Arbitrum Orbit rollup for decentralized AI
- $CAI: the native gas token for Cuckoo Chain

We're proud of our rapid growth, reaching the top 500K global websites within two months and launching innovative features like the Cuckoo Network Bridge for seamless asset transfers.
