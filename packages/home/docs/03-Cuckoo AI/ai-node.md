# How to Run a Miner Node

Miner nodes are integral to our network, taking on tasks and earning rewards through inference.

> Please note that miner nodes are still in heavy development and subject to substantial changes. Consequently, _there are no miner rewards available for now_.

## Stable Diffusion Miner

### Minimum Hardware Configuration

| Component          | Requirement               |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **GPU**            | NVIDIA L4, 3080           |
| **RAM**            | 8-16 GB                   |
| **CPU**            | 1 core                    |
| **Storage**        | Depends on traffic volume |

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run your Stable Diffusion Miner:

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/cuckoo-network/stable-diffusion-miner-docker.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    ```sh
    cd stable-diffusion-miner-docker
    ```

3. **Download the Necessary Files**

    ```sh
    make download
    ```

4. **Start the Miner**

   Add your private key to the command below and start the miner:

    ```sh
    ETH_PRIVATE_KEY="" make start
    ```

Ensure you have the required hardware and follow the setup instructions carefully. Stay tuned for updates as we continue to develop and enhance the miner node functionality.

### Bare-metal Ubuntu Server

#### Check NVIDIA GPU Information

To check the NVIDIA GPU information, use the following command:

```shell
nvidia-smi
```

If you encounter an error stating `NVIDIA-SMI has failed because it couldn't communicate with the NVIDIA driver. Make sure that the latest NVIDIA driver is installed and running.`, follow the steps below to resolve the issue.

#### Clean Up Existing NVIDIA Drivers

Remove existing NVIDIA drivers:

```shell
sudo apt remove --purge '^nvidia-.*'
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt clean
```

#### Check Available NVIDIA Drivers

List the available drivers:

```shell
ubuntu-drivers devices
```

Choose a recommended driver from the list. For example, to install `nvidia-driver-535`:

```shell
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535
```

#### Reboot the Server

After successfully installing the driver, reboot the server:

```shell
sudo reboot
```

This may resolve issues with the NVIDIA drivers on your Ubuntu server.
