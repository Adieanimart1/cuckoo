# Cuckoo Chain

**Decentralizing AI with a dedicated blockchain ecosystem**

Cuckoo Chain is a proof-of-stake, EVM-compatible blockchain, also functioning as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. It empowers users by distributing control and data ownership, fostering innovation in artificial intelligence while maintaining robustness and efficiency.


- **Staking for Trust**: Task scheduling in the Cuckoo Network is secured through staking $CUC tokens, establishing a proof of trust.
- **AI Models as ERC20 Tokens**: Each AI model inference is rewarded with ERC20 tokens, facilitating transparent and efficient transactions between coordinators and miner
