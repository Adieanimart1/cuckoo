## Problem

AI model serving is often centralized, expensive, and non-transparent. Additionally, GPUs remain scarce resources.

The Web3 industry addresses AI decentralization across various layers:

- **Infrastructure-as-a-Service Cloud**: Akash Network, Ritual, Render, NetMind.AI
- **Computing-Resource Marketplaces**: io.net, Gensyn, nimble, Kuzco, Morpheus AI
- **Model Tokenization and Training**: SaharaLabs, Bittensor, MyShell
- **AI Agents**: SingularityNET, Humans.ai, sensay, ChainGPT, AgentLayer
- **Data Tokenization**: Synesis One, Grass.io, GagaNode, Ocean Protocol
- **AI Applications**: inSure DeFi, Sleepless AI, NFPrompt, Hooked Protocol

We position ourselves within the computing-resource marketplace sector, but we believe that current solutions on the market fail to utilize GPU resources efficiently and do not create immediate value for AI end customers.

## Our Unique Approach

Our decentralized marketplace directly connects GPU miners with generative AI builders, allowing miners to serve AI models from day one. This approach maximizes the efficient use of GPU resources, reduces centralization risks, and ensures immediate value creation for AI consumers. By leveraging a decentralized network, we can significantly cut costs for generative AI builders by up to 60%.
