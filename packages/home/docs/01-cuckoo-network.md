# Cuckoo AI Overview

⚡️ **Cuckoo AI** is a decentralized model-serving marketplace enabling GPU and CPU miners to share their resources with generative AI app builders for image generation and LLM inference.

🧠 **Cuckoo AI** offers three key innovations:

- **Decentralized Multimodal Inference**:
  - **Coordinator Nodes** schedule inference tasks based on customer needs
  - **GPU Miner Nodes** perform inference by sharing GPU resources
- **Cuckoo Chain** an Arbitrum Orbit rollup for decentralized AI
- **$CUC**, the native coin for computing unit credits

💎 **$CUC** Overview:

1. Stake to establish trust in the AI network
2. Generate and share value
3. Reward contributors (builders, partners, and users)
4. Facilitate governance
5. Separate from stable-coin miner task rewards
